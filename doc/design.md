# Long Horizon Agent

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

<!-- Succinctly state the problem and impact of the problem. Avoid flowery or hyperbolic language. Be factual. -->

### 1.2 Proposed Solution

<!-- Succinctly state the design we propose to solve the problem starting with how the beneficiary of the design experiences the benefits of the proposed approach and working toward technical choices that enable it.

If there are notable limitations or trade-offs made by our design choice, note them briefly in a separate paragraph. If limitations are noted, also note why the chosen design is proposed as opposed to alternatives we considered. -->

## 2. User Interface

<!-- If user-facing functionality, describe the user experience for a specific scenario. Explain the scenario and the steps the user would take using the new or altered UX. If a CLI show how the user would accomplish tasks using commands and their flags and arguments.

If not a user-facing change, describe any new or significantly altered concepts in the system introduced by the proposed change. Omit the section if the design may easily be understood without illustrations. -->

## 3. Other Context

<!-- If the proposed change introduces a new technology or technique, background on that approach may be included here so that the implementor does not have to do background reading to understand the design, how to call new third-party libraries or APIs, etc. Include links to material for further exploration but aim to provide all of the basics needed for the reader to understand and start work on the proposed solution. -->

## 4. Technical Design

<!-- Describe the design starting from most fundamental concept of the proposal and proceed to explain each part of the solution in its own subsection. Number subsections as follows:

### 4.1 Component Name
#### 4.1.1 Sub-component

Illustrate with code examples, example output, diagrams, etc. Always specify a language for illustrations fenced with backticks, even for plaintext illustrations. -->

## 5. Implementation Plan

All milestones require:
- Passing lints (`make lint`)
- Passing type checks (`make typecheck`)
- Passing tests (`make test`)

<!-- Break down work into reviewable milestones. Use subsections for milestones each of which could be reviewed as a complete PR with a given goal and the code and tests required to achieve it. If user-facing functionality, succinctly describe what we should be able to demo with the completed PR. Organize the milestones such that the solution is developed in an iterative and incremental way.

Example:

### 5.1 Foundational Types and Classes (M1)

#### 5.1.1 Some Subsystem

- [ ] src/path1/file1.py
- [ ] tests/path1/test_file1.py

#### 5.1.2 Another Key Step

- [ ] src/path2/file2.py
- [ ] tests/path2/test_file2.py

### 5.2 Simple Command (M2)

Most basic demo of the proposed functionality.

### 5.3 Enhanced Feature (M3)
